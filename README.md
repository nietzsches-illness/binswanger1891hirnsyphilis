# Binswanger 1891: Hirnsyphilis und Dementia paralytica

See `.bib` file for full reference.

The original scan came from the PDF available via
<https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/XVCZV2J2HQPDNY5JIBS5GPHN2YHLAILI>
with thanks.

The link above has license recorded as "Public Domain Mark 1.0".

I (MB) redid the OCR using <https://app.transkribus.org>, with some
hand-editing.

I believe this text (from the OCR) is now in the public domain, because of its
age, but supported by the license on the original, noted above.

To make the PDF, run:

```bash
make
```

having installed [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
