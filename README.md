# Binswanger 1891: Hirnsyphilis und Dementia paralytica

See `binswanger1891hirnsyphilis.bib` file for full reference.

The original scan came from the PDF available via
<https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/XVCZV2J2HQPDNY5JIBS5GPHN2YHLAILI>
with thanks.

The link above has license recorded as "Public Domain Mark 1.0".

I (MB) redid the OCR using <https://app.transkribus.org>, with some
hand-editing.

I believe this text (from the OCR) is now in the public domain, because of its
age, but supported by the license on the original, noted above.

## Editing

I have deliberately left the Markdown version of the text with the same
line-wrapping as the original, to make it easier to compare to the original
text.  This includes hyphens and misspelling.

Please do propose edits, but do not rewrap the text.

At some stage, when it looks as though the Markdown text correctly represents
the printed text, I will reformat the Markdown text, removing hyphens and
joining hyphenated words.

## Building

To make the PDF, run:

```bash
make
```

having installed [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org).
